# CB BOT Framework cum Builder

Its just my forex bot builder. 

You can easily implement your own forex strategies using this framework. or can use mine (You wont make any money ðŸ˜…)

This will also help you to find anomalies with your strategy. when its work when it does not work

This will also give you REALTIME updates directly to your TELEGRAM app

AND I AM TOO LAZY TO MAKE THE DOCUMENTATION ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
so if you want to use this bot go through the documentation

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.
```
pip install talib [also install the c++ binaries ]
pip install fxcmpy
pip install datetime
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install pickle
pip install json
pip....
```
I think these are the only unique library 
(i dont have any requirement.txt so install anaconda other all dependencies are present there)

## Usage

```python
Paste the fxcm TOKEN inside
data/data_fetch.py
and also change the url with your own telegram bot url 
```

while making a new bot here If you can ... ðŸ˜… also change the url to get Realtime telegram updates
